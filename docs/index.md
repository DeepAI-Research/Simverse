Simian is a synthetic data generation tool for creating image caption or video caption pairs. What is novel about Simian is that it focuses on high-quality, specific captioning for features that are difficult to capture in current image and video description models-- for example camera movement, actor intent or physical interactions.

## Welcome

This documentation is intended to help you understand the structure of the Simian codebase and how to use it to generate synthetic data for your projects. Please select a topic from the sidebar to get started.

## Core Use Cases
Use Simian data to train image, video and 3D models.

- **Image and Video Generation**: Generate synthetic data for training image and video captioning models. Use Simian to create synthetic data for training image and video captioning models on real data. Mix with real data to add high-level controllability to your model.

- **3D Model Generation**: Generate random views or arranged spherical views for training 3D diffusion models.

- **Image and Video Description**: Use synthetic data to improve the quality of your captioning, descriptive or contrastive model on real data.

- **3D Object Detection**: Generate synthetic data for training 3D object detection models. Use Simian to create synthetic data for training 3D object detection models on real data.
